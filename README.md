## What this library offers?
- **Minimal**: It is a tiny yet crucial library for creating React apps in a much more faster and safer way.
- **Pure Abstraction**: It is so abstract that it doesn't even depend on react module. That means you can use it in any script too.
- **Fully Documented**: It is well-documented and contains type notations with [Flow](https://flow.org/).

## How to install? üöÄ
Since the package is in npm you can use command below to add it your project packages:

``` bash
npm i -D react-event-dispatcher
```

## How to use? üì¶
In your React file you have to import it in ES6 syntax:

``` js
import EventEmitter from 'react-event-emitter'
```
Now you have full access to the library. Cheers! Let's try it with a basic example:
``` js
const eventToDispatch = () => console.log('It really works üëå')
EventEmitter.emit('RandomComponent', eventToDispatch)
EventEmitter.triggerOne('RandomComponent')
// You should see 'It really works üëå' on your console.
```

## Motivation and Architecture
### Motivation
I have been working on quite a lot in React lately. And one of the proplems I had encountered a lot is event propagation between miscellaneous components. At some point it had been so cumbersome that I have left some of the projects that I have been dedicated for. So I wrote this minimal yet efficient library for React.

### Architecture
In its core the library uses a singleton Proxy pattern to achieve most of its work. The basic mechanism of library is given below:

## API üóÑÔ∏è
### ***emit***(key: *string*, $functionSet: *Function[]*): *void*
Dispatches the given function set to the event map(__$)

### ***getOne***(key: *string*, index: *number*): *Function*
Gets the function with the given key and index. Default index value is 0. When it fails to find the function (either key is absent or index is larger than the function set) it returns a function which throws an error and prints the error to the console.

### ***getAll***(key: *string*): *Function[]*
Gets the function set with the given key. It behaves the same as getOne when an error occurs (when key is not found in map).

### ***triggerOne***(key: *string*, index: *number*, ...args: *any[]*): *void*
Nearly the same of getOne. The only difference is it runs the function instead of returning it. It takes a extra argument as args which parameters to be injected in the target function. Index has no default value.

### ***triggerAll***(key: *string*, argsSet: *any[][]*): *void*
Same as triggerOne. However instead of running one function it runs a function set with the given argument set.

### ***clear***(): *void*
Clears the event map __$.
